         <p>My name is Joseph Pagani.  I am originally from NY, my wife and I moved out to WA about 6 years ago
         when I joined the Navy.  One weekends we like to explore new things in and around washington.  We like to play golf, 
         ski, snowboard and mountain bike and go day hikes or camp.  I currently work for Pinnacle Maintanace Group doing home repairs 
         and renovations and my wife is a Nurse.</p>
